## 📄LEETCODE SOLUTIONS

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in **Python**.

The solutions are organized by **difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard).

## 🚀 How I Solve Problems

1. **Understand the problem** – Read carefully and identify input/output.  
2. **Plan** – Think about brute-force and optimized approaches.  
3. **Code** – Write clean and readable Python code.  
4. **Test** – Use sample inputs and custom edge cases.  
5. **Optimize** – Improve time/space complexity if possible.

## 🧑‍💻 PROGRESS TRACKER

| Difficulty | Solved |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Easy       | 1 ✅    |
| Medium     | 2 ✅    |
| Hard       | 0 ✅    |

(Will keep updating as I solve more problems!)

# 🛠️ Languages Used
- Python 🐍 (primary)


## 🚀 How to Run

You can run solutions in **two ways**:
- Run from the solution file in shell.
Example -
```text
use python3 easy/validParenthesis.py
```

- Run from main.py (centralized runner).
Inside main.py you can test custom test cases.
Example:

```text
from easy.validParenthesis import Solution as ValidParenthesis

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = ValidParenthesis()
    print(sol.isValid("()"))    # True
    print(sol.isValid("([)]"))  # False
```

**Run it with python3 main.py**




# 🔆 Future Plans
- Add solutions in JavaScript.
- Write detailed solution for harder problems.
